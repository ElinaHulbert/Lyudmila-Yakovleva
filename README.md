# The very first portfolio-project at Hyper Island
##### :muscle: What was my motivation?
As the first project at Hyper Island we had to create a blog, but it felt too boring and I wanted to be able to refer to someone. Lyudmila has already had an established Instagram and it was easier for me to visualize the personality in that case. 
##### :books: What did I learn?
That is my first Vanilla JS project. Also, I got to know how to use JSON. I struggled with fetching at first, but took my time and re-did/modified this project later. Before this one, I have already tried HTML and CSS but it was some basic web (if you can even call it a website xd). 
##### :flashlight: How to use the project?
Use the link to get some random recipes from Lyudmila's collection (have not finished the feature):
